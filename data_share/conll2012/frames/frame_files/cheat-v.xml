            <note>Argument order suggested by comparison with remove (class 10.7).  Be
                very careful with distinguishing this sense from the following in
                transitive sentences.  To distinguish the senses, try adding an "of" or
                "out of" phrase to the sentence; only this sense can take that
                additional argument.  For example, the second example above can be
                modified to "Colleges are cheating the athletes out of a decent
                education."
