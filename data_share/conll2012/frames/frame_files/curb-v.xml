            <note>I don't really expect the higher-numbered args to appear, but they're
                there for reference.  Neither do I expect the sense of "please curb
                your dog".

        <note>Frames file for 'curb' based on sentences in financial subcorpus.
            No verbnet entry.  Comparison with 'reduce', but not really.  I'd
            rather have 'limit', but that hasn't been framed either.
