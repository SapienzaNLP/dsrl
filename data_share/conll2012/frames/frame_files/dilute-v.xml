                    Mr. Hahn said Georgia-Pacific has accounted in its strategy for a
                    ``significant downturn'' in the pulp and paper industry, an event
                    that he said *trace* would temporarily dilute earnings.

                    William O. McCoy, president of the company's BellSouth Enterprises

                    BellSouth earnings by about 9% in both 1990 and 1991.

                There's some financial usage of &quot;fully diluted stocks&quot; which I don't
                understand, but which is clearly adjectival and thus can be ignored.
