                    A dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which [*T*-1] was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it .
