                    Since its founding in 1818, Brooks Brothers, the standard-bearer
                    of the Ivy League look, has eschewed flashy sales promotions and
                    fashion trends -- the rules that most retailers live by.

                Although the etymology of eschew is unclear, it has nothing to do with
                chewing.
