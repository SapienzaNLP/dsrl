                    According to the myth, Old Order then vanishes at stage left and
                    reappears at extreme stage right, but Director Shuz skillfully
                    sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage effects by simply
                    having Miss Arapacis walk across the stage.

                    The tradition reached its apex, perhaps, in the works of Thomas
                    Nelson Page toward the end of the century, and reappeared [*-1]
                    undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel So Red The
                    Rose, by Stark Young.
