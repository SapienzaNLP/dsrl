                <text>When Isabella (Ellen Lauren) confronts her brother Claudio (Matt
                    Loney) in his cell, explaining the price she has been asked to
                    secure his freedom; when [Isabella and the disguised Duke (Philip
                    Kerr)]-4 conspire [*-4] to trick Angelo; and when Mariana (Annalee
                    Jefferies), a woman wronged by Angelo, confronts him with his
                    past misdeeds, the performers bring the dramatic high points to
                    life with intense energy and intelligence.
