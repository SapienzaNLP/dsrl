                <text>On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose, noticing one
                    another only when they jostle for cabs.

            <note>Unlike 'fight' (etc), this seems to only take a plural subject
                including both the fighter and the co-fighter(s), which are separate
                args for the 'fight' class. This sense doesn't seem to fit the VN class 'push', which would be something like "He jostled the lamp as he fell".
