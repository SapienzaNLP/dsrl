                <text>Dealers said the multinational oil company was pressured by recent
                    brokerage recommendations urging investors to switch into Shell
                    Trading &amp; Transport.

                <text>Analysts continued to speculate late last week that [Ford]-1 may try *trace*-1
                    to force the issue by *trace*-1 calling for a special shareholder's meeting
                    and urging that the government and Jaguar holders remove the
                    barriers to a full bidding contest before December 1990.

                This verb highlights the similarity between "force" and "request",
                which are currently framed oppositely.  One or the other will have to
                be changed, eventually.
