                    The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it-1
                    will retain an investment banker *trace*-1 to explore alternatives
                    ``*trace*-1 to minimize shareholder value,'' including the possible
                    sale of the company.

            <note>
                Agency has nothing to do with animacy, but tracing can get funky
                sometimes.  When the target of a trace is unclear, go with an animate
                agent.
