                <text>Globe columnist Mike Barnicle -- in the second attack on his
                    employer in as many weeks -- averred that his shadowy countenance
                    was so bad, it looked ``like a face you'd find on a bottle of
                    miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our
                    lifetime.''
