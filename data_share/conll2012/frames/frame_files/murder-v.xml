                <text>To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded
                    drop-in center for the homeless in New York: ``If you're
                    homeless, you-1 don't sleep for fear of *trace*-1 being robbed *trace*-1 or
                    murdered.

                <text>For example, one of my favorite movies is the 1949 British comedy
                    ``Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' in which the entire comedy is based
                    on actor Dennis Price's murdering eight titled relatives (all
                    played  by Alec Guinness) because they snubbed his mother and stand
                    in the way of his acquiring the family title.
