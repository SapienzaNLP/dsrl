                <note>The reason the last example was arg2 and this one is arg1 primarily comes down to the prepositional phrasing- "of her dedication" cannot appear with an additional arg1. It would have to be rephrased "of her FOR her dedication". The NP in the previous example could take an additional arg1.</note>
