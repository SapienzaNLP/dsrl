                    *trace*-1 To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term
                    value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth-1
                    also agreed to pay as much as $10 a share, or $540 million, if,
                    after five years, the trading value of the new cellular company
                    is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized
                    from the McCaw offer.

                I've always thought 'mollify' should also mean &quot;make someone be
                Molly&quot;, but that never seems to occur.
