                    The personal antics of agency Director Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow drew
                    much attention, such as when [several of his top aides]-1 were
                    uncovered *trace*-1 as KGB plants and ejected from France and when a
                    mysterious office fire was set just before Congress sent
                    accountants to trace U.S. funds.
