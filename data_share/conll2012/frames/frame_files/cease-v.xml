        <note>Frames file for 'cease' based on sentences in financial subcorpus.
            Verbnet entry 55.1, other framed members include begin, commence,
            proceed, and resume.  Logically, also 'stop' and 'end'.  Created by
            importing 'stop' and replacing lemmas.
            
            I actually think the instrumental examples sound pretty bad; I doubt
            any real instruments will occur.
