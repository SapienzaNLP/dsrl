                <text>Saab's problems were underscored Friday when the company announced
                    that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor ($186.1 million)
                    loss during the first eight months of this year, slightly worse
                    than Saab-Scania had forecast in its first-half report last
                    month.

                position, but treebank didn't put it there.
