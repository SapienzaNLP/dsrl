                    The night after [*] reading her letter about her surgeon uncle -- it must
                    have been late in September -- I had a vision of myself returned in ragged
                    uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and blooded , and
                    Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life .
