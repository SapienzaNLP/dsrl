                <text>Joseph Riccardo, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said
                    that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their
                    slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings, such as
                    consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs.
