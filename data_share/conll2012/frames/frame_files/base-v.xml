        <note>Frames file for 'base', based on first handful of sentences from big corpus
            
            There are some sentences where the arg1 is effectively a VP, such as
            "The bond is rated Triple-A based on the quality of the underlying
            loans".  As such, these do not lend themselves to having a nice arg1
            annotated, since there is no constituent holding the event (in this
            case, the rating) that does not also hold the basing event.  Bummer.
