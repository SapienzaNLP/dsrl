                <note>This frame has an issue in that it can have both a theme and a predicate: "Mary believed John that he didn't eat the last piece of pie". The problem is that we've been annotating both themes and predicates as arg1, so simply making either theme or predicate arg2 will conflict with past annotation. We could add an arg2, predicate, and use it only when arg1 is already present, but that makes me sad, so let's just not mess with it until we actually see such an instance.</note>
