                <text>That's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after
                    the 1987 crash, when individual investors fled the market
                    *trace* and trading activity dwindled .

                <text>The dispute started when China, angry that Hong Kong had allowed
                    dissident swimmer Yang Yang to flee to the U.S., halted the usual
                    daily transfer of illegal immigrants caught in this British
                    colony, which reverts to Beijing's control in 1997.

                <text>Many takeover stocks plunged Friday, as speculators retained their
                    confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the socalled whisper
                    stocks, the targets of rumored deals.
