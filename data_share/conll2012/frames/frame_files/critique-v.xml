                    Hong Kong director Stanley Kuan echoes this sentiment, * saying that
                    many films by Taiwanese directors tackling cultural identity and
                    critiquing status quo, couldcould never have been made * in Hong Kong,
                    perhaps because of distortions effected * by colonial education, or due
                    to political or commercial considerations.
