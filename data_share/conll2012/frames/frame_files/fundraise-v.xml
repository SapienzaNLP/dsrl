                    That impressed Robert B. Pamplin, Georgia-Pacific's chief
                    executive at the time, whom [Mr. Hahn]-1 had met while *trace*-1

                Ordinarily this would be &quot;so-and-so raised funds for X&quot; with &quot;funds&quot; in the
                arg1 position, but &quot;funds&quot; has been glommed onto the verbs itself and
                so cannot exist as an independent arg.  For consistency, though, the
                beneficiary is left in arg2.
