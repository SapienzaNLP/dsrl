                    With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who [*T*-1] had publicly
                    disowned his daughter : `` Fanny and Mrs. Godwin will probably be glad [*] to
                    hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement , and
                    that her child is well '' .
