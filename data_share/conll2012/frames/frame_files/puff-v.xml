                    Rachel wore a smart hat and, because she had been warned
                    recently about smoking, puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory
                    holder stained with lipstick.

                    He breathed now with his mouth open, showing a whitely curving
                    section of lower teeth; he kept his eyes, with their puffed blurred
                    lids, always lowered, though not, apparently, focusing.

                    It is interesting that, although the percentage of married
                    students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere -- about
                    30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating
                    class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate.

                    After walking out to his corral that morning, he'd been amazed
