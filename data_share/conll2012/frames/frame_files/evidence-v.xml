                    The use of [the abominable construction practices in the Soviet
                    Union]-1 -- as *trace*-1 evidenced *trace*-1 by the collapse of sand
                    apartment blocks during the Armenian earthquake -- as a metaphor
                    for the U.S. economic system was a sublime example of
                    Mr. Cockburn's satirical muse.

                    reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called  ``Bridget Loves
                    Bernie,'' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life
