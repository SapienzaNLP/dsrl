                <note>Many instances that are coming up are NOT eventive. If you can't replace the word "voice" with the word "vocalizing", and if it can't reasonably take an arg1, call it .ER. If it's referring to the thing you use to speak, that is not an event. Don't tag it.</note>

                <note>Note here that the first instance of the word 'voice' can be replaced by 'vocalizing', AND it takes an arg1. The second occurance of 'voice' is much more questionable as an event.</note>
