            <note>PReditor picks up prepositional usages of "like" (meaning "such as"
                and tagged as adjective) which should be ignored.  Even worse,
                "unlike" is picked up and included in the .arch files, so you'll see
                some sentences which at first glance seem to have no "like" predicates
                at all.

            <note>This proves that "like" cannot be treated as a modal, because English
                doesn't otherwise allow two modal verbs in a single sentences (with
                the exception of certain dialects, notably Southern, which might could
                say such things).
