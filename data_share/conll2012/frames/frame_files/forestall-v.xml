                    If the wedding party lasted late, and the travel schedule
                    means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an
                    early start, the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by
                    confiding to his bride that lying in each other's arms will be bliss
                    enough for these few hours.
