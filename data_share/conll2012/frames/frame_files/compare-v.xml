                <note>DO NOT TAG--compare is being used as a preposition (or even a conjunction!)
                    here.  Only tag if there is a trace in the tree, as in the following
                    two examples.  You can tell it's not a verb because you can't add an adverb:
                    "Apples compare well with oranges" but "*Apples are cheap, compared well
                    to oranges."
