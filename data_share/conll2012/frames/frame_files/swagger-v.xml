                    He behaved publicly with a cocky, swaggering truculence that offended
                    their vulpine Latin minds, and behaved towards them personally with
                    an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness.

                    The syntax would suggest that the truculence is swaggering, but
                    obviously that's incorrect; 'he' is the one swaggering.

                    He, too, cocked his cap at a jaunty angle, jingled marbles in his
                    pocket, and swaggered down Main Street.

                    Among my school and neighborhood friends, during the next months, I
                    bragged and swaggered and pompously described my impending date.
