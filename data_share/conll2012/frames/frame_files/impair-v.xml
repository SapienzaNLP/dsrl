                    The department would be required to block the buy-out if the
                    acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that
                    safety-27 would be impaired [*-27]; its ability to compete would be
                    sharply diminished; it would be put into foreign control; or if
                    the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets
                    -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit.
