            <note>Roleset based on verb frame play.01, member of Vncls performance-26.7-1-1. Framed by Claire.  Differs from verb frame play.01 with addition of arg3, opponent, and in lack of "music" sense. No noun instances seen applying to music, if this usage comes up we'll have to add an additional roleset as "opponent" is not compatible with musical senses.</note>
