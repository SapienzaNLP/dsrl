                    citizens overstay short-term vis as after [*] entering Russia will become a factor in tense relations between
                    China and Russia and how this problem should be solved [*T*-28] [*-27] [*T*-43] , Zemin Jiang expressed that
                    with the continuous development of friendly , neighborly relations between China and Russia in recent years
                    , the two countries are no longer isolated [*-44] from each other , and relations between them have
                    expanded , with rapidly increasing staff contacts .
