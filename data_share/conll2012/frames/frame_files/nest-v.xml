                    Below in the open bay facing Manhattan was Staten Island, gritty with
                    clam shells and mud flats behind which nested [*T*-2] farms, cattle
                    barns, and berry thickets.

                    A scant half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on
                    their diminutive terrace, the air about them scented with stock, and
                    listening to the nightingale who [*T*-1] had nested in the big lime
                    tree at the foot of the garden.

                    This raises the possibility of a super agent: John nested the bird in
                    Mary's lingerie drawer.  Either the existing args could be demoted
                    (0->1, 1->2) or an argA could be added.
