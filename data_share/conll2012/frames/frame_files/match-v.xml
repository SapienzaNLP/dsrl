            <note>The matched items all have the same status as arguments/semantic roles.
                
                There are passives
                
                (6a) The paint is matched (by the wallpaper)
                (6b) The wallpaper is matched (by the paint)
                
                but these are adjectival, not verbal, as the tests show: 
                
                The paint was unmatched 
                The paint is well matched
                *At noon, the paint was matched by the wallpaper
                
                Therefore, (6) are predicative sentences, and the participle is 
                an adjective, just like "peeling." So the (optional) by-phrase 
                is an adverbial; the noun in the by-phrase is not an A0 (agent) 
                argument.
                
                (6a) The paint is [matched (by the wallpaper)]
                AdjP
                (6b) The wallpaper is [matched (by the paint)]
                AdjP 
                
                (And therefore these cases are not to be tagged--Paul)
