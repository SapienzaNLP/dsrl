                <text>To say that the Pentagon should act irresponsibly because acting
                    responsibly will provoke Congress into acting irresponsibly leads
                    to the conclusion that the Pentagon should deliberately
                    exaggerate its needs in the national interest; in other words,
                    that it is justified in committing a crime --  lying to Congress
                    -- because it is morally superior.
