                <text>The company said it amended its shareholder rights plan by
                    reducing to 10% from 20% the level of ownership by an outsider
                    that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy
                    additional shares of Nashua common at half price.

                <text>PS of New Hampshire amended its plan to call for two years of 5.5%
                    rate increases followed by five years of 4.5% increases.

                <note>I read the following sentence as the plan now calls for such-and-such
                    increases, not that PS amended its plan in order to call for the
                    increases.  It's subtle.
