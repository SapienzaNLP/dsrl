                    Like Eliot, in my fantasies, I had a proud bearing and, with a skill
                    that was vaguely continental, I would lead Jessica through an evening
                    of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits, would
                    guide her gently to the night's climax which, in my dreams, was
                    always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death
                    with deep, moist kisses burning with love.
