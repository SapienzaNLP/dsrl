                <note>The syntax will determine the difference between the first and second
                    examples; by all rights "John to be an idiot" should be a single
                    constituent which could be called Arg1 all by itself, but there might
                    be cases with extraction ("John was understood to be an idiot") or
                    other cases where the two args are separate.  Try to keep things as a
                    single arg, if possible.
